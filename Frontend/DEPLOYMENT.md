# Deployment Guide for Vercel

## Files Added for Vercel Deployment:

### 1. vercel.json
- Configures URL rewrites to handle client-side routing
- All routes redirect to index.html for SPA functionality

### 2. public/_redirects  
- Fallback for other hosting platforms like Netlify
- Ensures all routes serve the main index.html

## Deployment Steps:

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   - Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
   - Vercel will automatically detect it's a Vite React app
   - The vercel.json file will handle routing automatically

3. **Manual Deployment (if needed):**
   ```bash
   npx vercel --prod
   ```

## Key Changes Made:

- ✅ Added proper client-side routing with useRouter hook
- ✅ Created Router component to handle different pages  
- ✅ Updated App.jsx to use the new routing system
- ✅ Added vercel.json for deployment configuration
- ✅ Updated Vite config for development server routing
- ✅ Removed full page reloads from navigation

## How it works:

1. All URL requests are redirected to index.html by Vercel
2. The React Router handles client-side navigation
3. No more 404 errors on direct URL access or page refreshes
4. Navigation between pages is now seamless without full page reloads

## Test the deployment:

After deployment, test these URLs directly:
- https://yourapp.vercel.app/
- https://yourapp.vercel.app/listing  
- https://yourapp.vercel.app/order

All should work without 404 errors!
